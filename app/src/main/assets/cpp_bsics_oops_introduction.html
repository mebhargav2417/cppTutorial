        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems with Structured Oriented Programming or Procedure Oriented Programming leads to Object Oriented Programming Development.
        As we know languages like C, COBOL, FORTRON commonly known as Procedure Oriented Programming languages. Generally procedure oriented programming consists of writing 
        list of instructions into groups known as <i>functions</i>. Some of the characteristics of procedure oriented programming language is listed below.
        <ol>
            <li>Large programs are divied into small programs called functions.</li>
            <li>Mostly functions share global data.</li>
            <li>Follows top down approach.</li>
            <li>Data moves freely from function to function around the system. So no restriction access available.</li>
        </ol>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than procedure oriented programming, object oriented programming does not share data freely around the system. It considers
        data as a critical element. It combines data and functions as single unit known as Object. So these data and functions are binding up of into single unit,
        with the help of objects we will access those data and functions. The following are the concepts of Object oriented programming language.
        <ol>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <li>Objects</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Data abstraction</li>
            <li>Data encapsulation</li>
            <li>Message passing</li>
        </ol>
