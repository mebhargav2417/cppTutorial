        <h1>Standard Template Library</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee of Hewlett Packard developed a set of general purpose template classes (data structures) and functions (algorithms)
            helps to storing and processing of data in standard approach. The collection of the generic classes and functions called <b>STL</b> (<i>Standard Template Library</i>).
            <br><br>
            STL components are :
            <ol>
                <li>Containers</li>
                <li>Algorithms</li>
                <li>Iterators</li>
            </ol>        
            <b>Containers</b> helps to store data in organized way(data structures) like arrays, list, queue and so on. Also these are generic too, they can hold elements of any data
            type, for example: <i>vectors</i> can be used to create dynamic arrays of char, integer, string and other.
            <br><br>
            <b>Algorithms</b> helps to process the data in the containers. STL have many different types of algorithms to provide support for tasks such as searching, sorting, copying
            and merging.
            <br><br>
            <b>Iterators</b> are like pointers used to access elements in the container. Used to traverse from one element to another(nothing but <i>iterating</i> through the container).
            <br><br>
            STL components which are now part of the Standard C++ Library are defined in the <b>namespace std.</b> So we must use the directive as follows<br><br>
            <i>using namespace std;</i><br><br>
            it informs to compiler that we intend to use the Standard C++ Library.
