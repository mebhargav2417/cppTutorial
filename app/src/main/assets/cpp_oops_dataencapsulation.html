        <h1>Classes</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes are nothing but user defined data type, having its own data members and member functions. We will access those using instance of class also known as <b>objects.</b>
                Variables and functions which are defined and implemented for classes are called data members and member function.
            <br>
            Let us consider a class called <b>Rectangle</b> which helps to draw rectangle shape and to calculate of its area. Rectangle have length and breadth, nothing but variables for class rectangle.
            With the help of draw and area functions we will get shape of rectangle and its area. Those area and draw are member functions for class rectangle.
            <br><br>
            <u>Class syntax is as follows</u>
            <br><br>
            class &lt;<i>Class name</i>&gt;{<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access Specifier:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data members;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member functions;<br>
            }; <br> <br>
            Example for classes is as follows:<br><br>
            class Rectangle { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int length, breadth;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void draw(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//definition of draw function<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void area();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//definition of area function<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            }; <br> <br>

            From the above example, public is an access specifier or visibility control. With help of this access specifier we will perform data hiding. Nothing but we will control the access of data members 
            and member functions from outside of class environment. Data members are length and breadth of int data type. Draw and area are class member functions.

            <h1>Objects</h1>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Object is an instance of class. We can access data members and member functions of class using object. An object is also called class data type.
