        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
     C++ is an object oriented programming language but it is not purely object oriented because its features like friend and virtual violates some of very important features of OOPS.
